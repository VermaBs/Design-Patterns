/**
The example also shows how Builder produces products of different kinds (car manual) using the same building steps.

The Director controls the order of the construction. It knows which building steps to call to produce this or that car model.
It works with builders only via their common interface. This allows passing different types of builders to the director.

The end result is retrieved from the builder object because the director canâ€™t know the type of resulting product. 
Only the Builder object knows what does it build exactly.
